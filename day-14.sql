-- Table Schema:
-- Table: focus_challenges
--   member_id: INTEGER
--   member_name: VARCHAR
--   start_date: DATE
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT 
      member_id,
      member_name,
      start_date AS focus_start_date,
      (start_date + INTERVAL '14 days')::DATE AS focus_end_date
FROM focus_challenges
GROUP BY member_id, member_name, start_date;
