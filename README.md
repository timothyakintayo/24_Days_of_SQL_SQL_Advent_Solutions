# 24 Days of SQL: SQL Advent Challenge Solutions 🎄📊

This repository contains my complete solutions to the SQL Advent Challenge by InterviewMaster.ai, where I committed to solving one SQL problem every day for 24 consecutive days. The goal of this challenge was not just to write correct queries, but to build strong analytical thinking, practice interview-level SQL, and develop a habit of consistent problem solving using real-world datasets.

## About the Challenge

The SQL Advent Calendar is a festive coding challenge featuring 24 days of SQL problems, hosted by Interview Master.

## 🧠 What This Repository Demonstrates
Over 24 days, I worked through problems ranging from easy to advanced, covering:
- Core SQL fundamentals (SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING)
- Joins (INNER, LEFT, CROSS)
- Window functions  
  (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`, `NTILE`, `FIRST_VALUE`, `LAST_VALUE`)
- Time-based analysis  
  (`DATE_TRUNC`, `INTERVAL`, date filtering, trend analysis)
- Analytical metrics  
  (ratios, percentages, per-unit calculations)
- Data cleaning & preparation  
  (`COALESCE`, NULL handling, conditional logic)
- Business-focused problem solving using realistic scenarios  
Each solution focuses on correct granularity, business logic, and clarity, mirroring how SQL is used in real analytics and data roles.
