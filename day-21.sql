-- Table Schema:
-- Table: story_log
--   log_date: DATE
--   stories_shared: INT
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT
    log_date,
    stories_shared,
    SUM(stories_shared) OVER (
        ORDER BY log_date
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS total_stories_shared
FROM story_log
ORDER BY log_date;
