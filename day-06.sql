-- Table Schema:
-- Table: resort_monthly_snowfall
--   resort_id: INT
--   resort_name: VARCHAR
--   snow_month: INT
--   snowfall_inches: DECIMAL

-- My Solution:

SELECT 
      sub.resort_name,
      sub.total_snow_fall,
      NTILE(4) OVER(ORDER BY sub.total_snow_fall) AS ski_quartiles
FROM 
(
SELECT 
      resort_id, 
      resort_name,
        SUM(snowfall_inches) AS total_snow_fall
  FROM resort_monthly_snowfall
  GROUP BY resort_id, resort_name
) AS sub
