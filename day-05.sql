-- Table Schema:
-- Table: elves
--   elf_id: INT
--   elf_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: vacations
--   elf_id: INT
--   start_date: DATE
--   return_date: DATE
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT 
      elf_name,
      CASE 
      WHEN return_date IS NULL THEN 'Still resting' 
      ELSE return_date 
      END AS return_date
FROM elves e
LEFT JOIN vacations v
ON e.elf_id = v.elf_id
