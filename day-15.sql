-- Table Schema:
-- Table: grinch_mischief_log
--   log_date: DATE
--   mischief_score: INTEGER
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT 
      log_date AS log_date,
      mischief_score AS mischief_score,
      LAG(mischief_score,1) OVER (ORDER BY log_date) AS mischief_score_day_before,
      mischief_score -  LAG(mischief_score,1) OVER (ORDER BY log_date) AS mischief_score_changes
FROM grinch_mischief_log;
