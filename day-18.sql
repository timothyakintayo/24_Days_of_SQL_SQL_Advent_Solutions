-- Table Schema:
-- Table: daily_quiz_scores
--   subject: VARCHAR
--   quiz_date: DATE
--   score: INTEGER
--

-- My Solution:

WITH score_cte AS (
SELECT 
      *,
    FIRST_VALUE(score) 
      OVER(PARTITION BY subject ORDER BY quiz_date) AS first_score,
      LAST_VALUE(score) OVER (PARTITION BY subject ORDER BY quiz_date
      ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS last_score
FROM daily_quiz_scores
)
SELECT 
      subject,
      first_score,
      last_score
FROM score_cte
GROUP BY subject;
