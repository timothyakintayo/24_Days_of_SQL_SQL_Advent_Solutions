-- Title: The Grinch's Best Pranks Per Target
-- Difficulty: hard
--
-- Question:
-- The Grinch has brainstormed a ton of pranks for Whoville, but he only wants to keep the top prank per target, with the highest evilness score. Return the most evil prank for each target. If two pranks have the same evilness, the more recently brainstormed wins.

-- Table Schema:
-- Table: grinch_prank_ideas
--   prank_id: INTEGER
--   target_name: VARCHAR
--   prank_description: VARCHAR
--   evilness_score: INTEGER
--   created_at: TIMESTAMP
--

-- My Solution:

WITH pranch_ideas AS
  (
SELECT 
  prank_id,
  RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY target_name ORDER BY evilness_score DESC, created_at DESC) AS evil_rank
FROM grinch_prank_ideas
)
SELECT prank_id
FROM pranch_ideas
WHERE evil_rank = 1;
