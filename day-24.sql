-- Table Schema:
-- Table: user_goals
--   user_id: INT
--   user_type: VARCHAR
--   goal_id: INT
--   goal_status: VARCHAR
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT 
      a.user_type,
      ROUND(AVG(a.tot_comp_goals), 2) AS avg_com_goals

FROM (

SELECT 
      user_id,
      user_type,
      COUNT(*) AS tot_comp_goals

FROM user_goals 
WHERE goal_status = 'Completed' 
GROUP BY user_id, user_type
) a
GROUP BY a.user_type;
