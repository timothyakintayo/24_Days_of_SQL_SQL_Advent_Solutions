-- Table Schema:
-- Table: holiday_orders
--   order_id: INT
--   customer_name: VARCHAR
--   gift_wrap: BOOLEAN
--   paper_used_meters: DECIMAL
--   delivery_status: VARCHAR
--   order_date: DATE
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT
      SUM(paper_used_meters) AS total_wrapping_paper
FROM holiday_orders
WHERE (gift_wrap IS true
AND delivery_status = 'Delivered'
);
