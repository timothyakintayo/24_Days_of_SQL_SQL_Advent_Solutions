-- SQL Advent Calendar - Day 17
-- Title: Evening Task Categories
-- Difficulty: medium
--
-- Question:
-- During a quiet evening of reflection, Cindy Lou wants to categorize her tasks based on how peaceful they are. Can you write a query that adds a new column classifying each task as 'Calm' if its noise_level is below 50, and 'Chaotic' otherwise?

-- Table Schema:
-- Table: evening_tasks
--   task_id: INTEGER
--   task_name: VARCHAR
--   noise_level: INTEGER
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT *,
      (CASE 
      WHEN noise_level < 50 THEN 'Calm'
      ELSE 'Chaotic'
      END) AS noise_level_classification
FROM evening_tasks;
